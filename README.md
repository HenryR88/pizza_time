# pizza_time


In Pizza_Time the player controls an eater at the bottom of the screen. The player can move right, left, up and down using the arrow keys to catch pizzas. When the game begins, a number of pizzas fills the top of the screen and moves across and down the screen. The player catches all the pizzas and a new batch appears that moves faster than the previous batch. If any pizza reaches the bottom of the screen, the player loses a round of the game. If the player loses three rounds, the game ends. 

The game is programmed in Python using pygame package. I play it in spare time to stop eating junk food :)  The scoring system reminds me of calories consumed with each pizza slice. 

When I have free time, will work to improve game's features and more information about the game.

Would be good to get ideas on how to diversify images for food and add new features to the game.

I have set the main file pizz_time.py to open in full screen mode when run IDE or terminal, to exit press Q key on keyboard.
