# pizza_time


In Pizza_Time the player controls an eater at the bottom of the screen. The player can move right and left using the arrow keys and catch pizzas using the spacebar. When the game begins, a number of pizzas fills the top of the screen and moves across and down the screen. The player catches all the pizzas and a new batch appears that moves faster than the previous batch. If any pizza reaches the bottom of the screen, the player loses a round of the game. If the player loses three rounds, the game ends. 

The game is programmed in Python using pygame package. I play it in spare time to stop eating junk food :)  The scoring system reminds me of calories consumed with each pizza slice. 

When I have free time, will work to improve game's features. 

Would be good to get ideas on how to diversify images for food and add new features to the game.
