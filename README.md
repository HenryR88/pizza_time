# pizza_time
A quick game programmed in Python using pygame package to play in spare time and stop eating junk food. The scoring system reminds me of calories consumed with each pizza slice. 
When I have free time, will work to improve game's features. 
Would be good to get ideas on how to diversify images for food and add new features to the game.
